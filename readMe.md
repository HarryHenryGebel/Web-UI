# Water Me

### Project status
_Paused to allow breathing room untill such a time as one of us decides to pick it back up and play around with making it even more epic._

## A Houseplant Watering Scheduler

Live at: [https://water-me.netlify.app/pip](https://water-me.netlify.app/)
A Lambda School Build Week project to test our skills and save the world, one succulent at a time. Everything accomplished in 4 days, with potential polish and refactoring in the future. Some features still theoretical, but enough accomplished to fulfill all our MVP's & many stretch goals. The aim of the website is to begin creating a product that can allow users to create an account, and input all their houseplants. Each houseplant will have it's own watering schedule that can eventually be updated every watering until the user has found the perfect schedule for their home. My task was to create the Landing Page, Marketing Page & About Page, proving my HTML & CSS chops. All the other fun juicy bits of frontend & backend went to the rest of my brilliant team slaving away.


## Installation
Runs off of netlify, heroku, React, & a whole bunch of things I don't yet understand. Give me a couple months & it'll be a whole 'nother matter.


## Support
Leave a comment in in the repo, pretty please.
That is a thing that can be done right?

### Personal Notes
Extra img's in assets to create more content.
07.30.20 - First Lambda School Build Week after a whopping 3 weeks on instruction on HTML/CSS/Javascript. Zero prior coding or web design experience. Damn, Lambda is good.
