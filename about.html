            <h2>Brought together...</h2>
            <p>by the powers that be. We are a group of misfit programers making the world better one website at a time. Spanning the country, we’ve coordinated across time-zones to fight against houseplant deaths. We envision a world where greenery can thrive in every home, without resorting to silk plants or hiring certified plant waterers. Our current mission is to train up an army of global citizens that can say with confidence, “Why yes, I do water my ficus only when it needs it.” Eventually, if we have our way, not only will everyone have lush surroundings and plenty of silent green friends, but the compassion they train in the process will bring us one step closer to world peace & harmony. After all, it’s hard to be a curmudgeon when you’re cooing to your cacti every day. </p>

                <p>When I started WaterMe Industries, I had just two things in my possession: a dream and an amazing gaming chair. It’s impressive what my minions have brought forth since our inception. Once time travel is realized & I can visit the future to see all the wonderful new technologies, I’ll definitely be keeping an eye out to witness the impact we’ve had on the world. Keep your eye’s peeled on my next grand adventures and prepare to be even more amazed at what we create next.</p>

                <h3>Front End Wizard</h3>
                <p>It’s ok. I’ll distract Nickolas and prevent his time traveling ways. Far too many masterminds just don’t understand the paradoxes involved and the risk of destabilizing the time-continuum. Very bad for world peace. Or very good for world peace if you just want silence after everything rips apart. Not that I recommend the later, but some people you just can’t understand. It’s been amusing working with this team, as sometimes I feel like I’m the only one who grew up surrounded by agriculture and chickens. Growing things should be easy, & I don’t know why people don’t already grasp the simplicity of it, but I hope this helps. It should make houseplants even easier than differential calculus.</p>

                <p>Don’t make me come over there. Trust me when I tell you it’s better for you to just accept facts. Yes, your life will be better with houseplants. No, I don’t care how hard it’s been for you in the past, we’ve all had hard pasts. Much like theatre and opera, there are many struggles along the way, but if you truly want it, go out there & grab it by the horribly-irrelevant-horned-helmet. And yes, he's a wizard, Harry. But I am the sorceress.<p>
